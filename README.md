#### Web Page File Creation 

I ensured that a separate HTML file was created for each main section of the website. The files include:
  * home.html
  * about_us.html
  * events.html
  * contact_us.html

This structure helps organize the content clearly and supports smooth navigation across the site.

I staged the changes and pushed them directly to the main branch using Git commands.

#### After creating the file, I added comments within the code to describe its purpose and improve readability for future reference.
